# Electron Music Utility
## Preface
* This project is to help mitigate the headaches that I currently run into by trying to manage all my song files.
* Mainly, this pertains to editing the song name and moving them into the correct folder for playlist detection
* Please bear with me as this application provides basic abilities, this might be expanded in the future （πーπ）
* As of 2021-01-29, this has been fully converted over to typescript

### Current issues
    "use strict";
    exports.__esModule = true;
* Delete this from transpiled JS files, not sure why these are giving me an issue
