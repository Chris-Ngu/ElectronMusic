# Electron Music Utility
## Preface
* This project is to help mitigate the headaches that I currently run into by trying to manage all my song files.
* Mainly, this pertains to editing the song name and moving them into the correct folder for playlist detection
* I am currently using this foundation to understand electron and how web-based technologies are used to create cross-platform desktop applications. 
* Please bear with me as this application provides basic abilities, this might be expanded in the future


### Main features to work on
* Song rename, need to refresh the page to reflect name change of song 

 ### Song playback
 * ~~Include audio package to preview songs~~ Can include in the future

### Design
* Work on layout of application
* Handle new menu bar buttons (not working for some reason). Placeholder implementation in place for the time
 
### Right click/ song click menu
* RIGHT CLICK: Programatically detect what is being right clicked and dynamically build the MenuItems
* ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47756822/change-electrons-menu-items-status-dynamically


### Future designs
* Port to Electron + React?
