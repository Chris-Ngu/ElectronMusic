# Electron Music Utility
## Preface
* This project is to help mitigate the headaches that I currently run into by trying to manage all my song files.
* Mainly, this pertains to editing the song name and moving them into the correct folder for playlist detection
* I am currently using this foundation to understand electron and how web-based technologies are used to create cross-platform desktop applications. 
* Please bear with me as this application provides basic abilities, this might be expanded in the future （πーπ）


### Main features to work on
* buttonLoad.js -> FILE IS UNMAINTAINABLE IF IT GROWS TOO LARGE, filling song div has three seperate copies. Need to clean and combine into one single function
* Add actions to a history stack


### Future designs
* Port to Electron + React?
* Typescript
* Prototyped code, clean up codebase
