# Electron Music Utility
## Preface
* This project is to help mitigate the headaches that I currently run into by trying to manage all my song files.
* Mainly, this pertains to editing the song name and moving them into the correct folder for playlist detection
* I am currently using this foundation to understand electron and how web-based technologies are used to create cross-platform desktop applications. 
* Please bear with me as this application provides basic abilities, this might be expanded in the future

 ### Song playback
 * ~~Include audio package to preview songs~~ Can include in the future
 * SONG PLAYBACK IS FREEZING WHOLE PAGE, Probably due to korean letters in the file name; need a different way to play these songs

### Design
* Work on layout of application
* Handle new menu bar buttons (not working for some reason). First implementation removed
 
### Future designs
* Port to Electron + React?
